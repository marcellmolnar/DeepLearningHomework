abstract = {We consider discrete optimization problems with the objective functions which can be defined as a response to a controllable real-time process, or obtained through computer simulation. To solve the problems, a random search algorithm and its parallel implementation are developed. A performance analysis of both serial and parallel algorithms is given, and related numerical results are discussed.},
